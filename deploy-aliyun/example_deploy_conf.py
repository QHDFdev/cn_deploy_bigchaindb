# AWS deployment config file

# To use in a Bash shell script:
# source example_deploy_conf.py
# # $EXAMPLEVAR now has a value

# To use in a Python script:
# from example_deploy_conf import *
# or
# import importlib
# cf = importlib.import_module('example_deploy_conf')
# # cf.EXAMPLEVAR now has a value

# DON'T PUT SPACES AROUND THE =
