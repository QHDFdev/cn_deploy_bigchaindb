"""Release all allocated but non-associated elastic IP addresses
(EIPs). Why? From the AWS docs:

``To ensure efficient use of Elastic IP addresses, we impose a small
hourly charge if an Elastic IP address is not associated with a
running instance, or if it is associated with a stopped instance or
an unattached network interface. While your instance is running,
you are not charged for one Elastic IP address associated with the
instance, but you are charged for any additional Elastic IP
addresses associated with the instance. For more information, see
Amazon EC2 Pricing.''
